 Here’s your weekly review task:


Create a mini receipt calculator program.
Ask the user for the name, price, and quantity of two items.
Use at least one function for calculating each item's total (price × quantity) and another for the overall total.
Show all prices/totals with two decimal places. Make sure your receipt is neatly formatted.
Print each item's name, price, quantity, total, and then the overall cart total at the end.
Your code should be clean, with good variable and function names, and your prompts/output should be clear to users.

Example output (yours does not have to match exactly, but should look clear and professional):


Item: Apple
Price: 1.5$
Quantity: 4
Total price: 6.00$
-------------------
Item: Cream cheese
Price: 3.45$
Quantity: 3
Total price: 10.35$

Total cart price: 16.35$
